## Overview of the Analysis  

This project uses Python Machine Learning to create a Model to predict loan repayment status ... as being either "healthy", or "high-risk".

The Model is trained on a lending data set that includes a known loan repayment status.  
In particular, the column "loan_status" contains a (0) value if a loan is considered "healthy" and very likely to be repaid, or else contains a (1) value if the loan is considered "high-risk" and in danger of not being repaid.  
Since we have this known "loan_status" value available, a "Supervised" Machine Learning technique is appropriate for creating a Model to predict "loan_status" loan repayment results.  
  
The steps taken to create the Model:  
- clean the data (data set was already clean)  
- seperate the data, so it can be used to train a ML model:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "labels (y)"   ... containing only the "loan_status" column results  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "features (X)" ... contains all remaining columns after omiting "loan_status"  
- split the (X) and (y) data into seperate "training" and "testing" datasets using "train_test_split()"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (X_train, y_train) ... used to fit and train the Model  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (X_test, y_test)   ... set aside, then later used to test and evaluate Model  
- encoding categorical data (unecessary as data set only contain numeric data)  
- scale numerical "features (X)" data (both X_train "training" , and X_test "testing") using "StandardScaler" "transform()"
- instantiate a "LogisticRegression" Model from the "sklearn.linear_model" module  
- "fit" the Model using the "training" "features (X)" and "labels (y)" data ... found in (X_train, y_train)
- calculate Model "predictions" using the "testing" "features (X)" data ... found in (X_test)
- evaluate the Model's results using the following tools ( by comparing the "testing" data's (y_test) "actual" results that were set aside earlier , to the "predictions" results generated by running the Model upon the "testing" (X_test) data )  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "Confusion Matrix"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "Accuracy Score"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "Classification Report"  

## Results  

```
Loan Status - Key
===============================================
(0) "healthy"   , very likely to be repaid
(1) "high-risk" , in danger of not being repaid


Confusion Matrix
====================================
           Predicted 0   Predicted 1
Actual 0        18652           113
Actual 1           10           609

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    True  Negative (TN):   18652    Actual 0 in data set, and Model Predicted 0 ... match
    False Positive (FP):     113    Actual 0 in data set, but Model Predicted 1 ... mismatch
    False Negative (FN):      10    Actual 1 in data set, but Model Predicted 0 ... mismatch
    True  Positive (TP):     609    Actual 1 in data set, and Model Predicted 1 ... match
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    (!) False Negative (FN)
        This is the most concerning scenario for a lender.
        The Model predicted these loans are healthy, but they are actually high-risk.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Accuracy Score
==================
0.9936545604622369

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Overall, the Model has a 99.37% chance of correctly identifying a loan correctly.

    However, worth noting, is that the ratio between actual healthy, and actual high-risk
      loans is not balanced.
    Since actual total high-risk loans (619) is so much smaller than the actual total
      healthy loans (18765) , one must be aware that any Model inacuracy
      will disproportionately affect the high-risk side more negatively.

    Class (0) "healthy"   , very likely to be repaid

        Precision    1.00    The model predicts healthy loans with high accuracy,
                               correctly identifying almost all healthy loans
                               without misclassifying them as high-risk loans.

        Recall       0.99    The model correctly identifies 99% of all actual healthy loans.  
                               This means the model is very effective in recognizing healthy loans.  
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
    Class (1) "high-risk" , in danger of not being repaid

        Precision    0.84    When the model predicts a loan as high-risk, it is correct 84% of the time.  
                               This indicates some level of false positives,
                               meaning not all loans predicted as high-risk are actually high-risk.

        Recall       0.98    The model correctly identifies 98% of all actual high-risk loans.  
                               This high recall suggests that the model is very good at catching
                               most high-risk loans, but there may be some false positives.  
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
```
## Summary  
  
The logistic regression model performs very well in predicting both (0) "healthy", and (1) "high-risk" class labels:  
  
 - For Healthy Loans (Class 0): The model achieves near-perfect precision and recall, effectively identifying healthy loans with very few misclassifications.  
 - For High-Risk Loans (Class 1): The model has a high recall, meaning it successfully identifies almost all high-risk loans. However, precision is slightly lower, indicating that while the model is good at identifying high-risk loans, there is a small rate of false positives (where Healthy loans are misclassified as High-Risk).  
  
Per a ChatGPT conversation ... a loan default rate of 1%-3% is considered acceptible for Consumer loans , while a loan default rate of only 1% is considered acceptible for Mortgage loans.  
  
When considering this Model for Consumer loans ... this Model can be recommended!  
It finds 98% of High-Risk loans , which means the 2% default rate is considered acceptible.  
  
However, when considering this Model for Mortgage loans ... this Model can Not be recommended as-is!  
The Model would need to be fine-tuned to reach the acceptible 1% default rate.
